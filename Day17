1️⃣ What is an Iterator?

An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse (loop through) data.

Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for n in numbers:
    print(n)

Here list is iterable.

Using iter() and next()
numbers = [10, 20, 30]

it = iter(numbers)

print(next(it))
print(next(it))
print(next(it))

After last element → StopIteration error.

2️⃣ What is a Generator?

A generator is a special function that:

Uses yield

Generates values one at a time

Saves memory

Normal Function
def count():
    return [1, 2, 3]
Generator Version 🔥
def count():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for num in count():
    print(num)
3️⃣ Why Generators Are Powerful?

Normal list stores everything in memory.

Generator:

Produces value only when needed

Memory efficient

Used in large data processing

4️⃣ Generator with Loop
def numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

for num in numbers(5):
    print(num)
5️⃣ Generator Expression

Like list comprehension but uses () instead of [].

gen = (x*x for x in range(5))

for value in gen:
    print(value)
🔥 Where Generators Are Used?

Big data

File processing

Streaming data

AI / ML pipelines

🧠 Memory Trick

yield → pause & return value

Generator → memory efficient

iter() → make iterator

next() → get next value

📝 Practice Tasks

1️⃣ Create generator to print numbers 1 to 10
2️⃣ Create generator for even numbers
3️⃣ Convert list to iterator and use next()
4️⃣ Create generator expression for squares
