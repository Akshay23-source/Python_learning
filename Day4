1️⃣ Why Loops?

Loops are used to repeat work without writing code again and again.

👉 Example:
Print numbers 1 to 10 (without writing 10 print statements).

2️⃣ for Loop

Used when you know how many times to repeat.

Syntax
for variable in range(start, end):
    code

Example
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


Output

1
2
3
4
5


📌 range(1, 6) → 1 to 5 (end is excluded)

3️⃣ while Loop

Used when repetition depends on a condition.

Syntax
while condition:
    code

Example
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

4️⃣ break and continue

Very important in loops.

break → stop loop
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

continue → skip current step
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)

5️⃣ Loop with User Input
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(n, "x", i, "=", n*i)


👉 This prints multiplication table.

🧠 Memory Trick

for → fixed range

while → condition-based

break → exit

continue → skip
