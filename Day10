Topic: File Handling in Python


1️⃣ Why File Handling?

Until now, data disappears after program ends.
File handling lets you:

Store data permanently

Read saved data

Build real applications

2️⃣ Opening a File

Syntax:

file = open("filename.txt", "mode")

Modes:

"r" → read

"w" → write (overwrites file)

"a" → append

"x" → create file

3️⃣ Write to File
file = open("demo.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello Akshay\n")
file.write("Python is powerful")
file.close()


👉 This creates demo.txt.

4️⃣ Read from File
file = open("demo.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()

5️⃣ Append to File
file = open("demo.txt", "a")
file.write("\nNew line added")
file.close()

6️⃣ Best Practice (Important 🔥)

Use with (auto closes file)

with open("demo.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())


No need for close().

7️⃣ Read Line by Line
with open("demo.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)

🧠 Memory Trick

w → wipe & write

a → add

r → read

with → safe method
