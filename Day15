1️⃣ What is List Comprehension?

It is a short and powerful way to create lists.

Normal Way
numbers = []

for i in range(1, 6):
    numbers.append(i)

print(numbers)
List Comprehension Way 🔥
numbers = [i for i in range(1, 6)]
print(numbers)

Much cleaner.

2️⃣ With Condition
Normal Way
even = []

for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even.append(i)
List Comprehension
even = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i % 2 == 0]
print(even)
3️⃣ Square of Numbers
squares = [i*i for i in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
4️⃣ Working with Strings
words = ["python", "java", "c++"]

upper_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(upper_words)
5️⃣ Dictionary Comprehension 🔥
squares = {i: i*i for i in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)

Output:

{1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25}
6️⃣ Set Comprehension
unique_squares = {i*i for i in range(1, 6)}
print(unique_squares)
🔥 Why This Is Important?

Makes code shorter

Used in interviews

Used in data science

Makes you look like pro programmer 😎

🧠 Memory Trick

Structure:

[expression for item in iterable if condition]
