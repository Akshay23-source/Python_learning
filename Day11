Topic: OOP – Classes & Objects (Very Important)



1️⃣ What is OOP?

OOP = Object Oriented Programming

Instead of writing everything separately,
we create objects that contain data + functions.

Real-life example:

Car = object

Color → data

Speed → data

Drive() → function

2️⃣ What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

Basic Syntax
class Student:
    name = "Akshay"


Create object:

s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)

3️⃣ Constructor (__init__) – Very Important 🔥

Constructor runs automatically when object is created.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s1 = Student("Akshay", 20)
print(s1.name)
print(s1.age)

What is self?

self refers to the current object.

Think like:

self.name → this object's name

4️⃣ Adding Methods (Functions inside class)
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name)

s1 = Student("Akshay")
s1.greet()

5️⃣ Multiple Objects
s1 = Student("Akshay")
s2 = Student("Rahul")


Each object has its own data.

🔥 Why OOP is Important?

Used in big software systems

Required in interviews

Used in ML frameworks

Used in game development

🧠 Memory Trick

class → blueprint

object → real thing

__init__ → constructor

self → current object
